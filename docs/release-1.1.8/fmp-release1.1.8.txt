# Instructions

The FMP data upsert job has been updated to better accomodate these data loads

So please update FMP_EA_102_UPSERT_DATA to match the Dev version.

Quickest way is to copy and paste the job properties into a text doc, drop the old job and copy accross FMP_DEV_102_UPSERT_DATA, then update the properties with the production ones and set the jenkins slave to the correct one.

Then:

- Execute job FMP_EA_102_UPSERT_DATA (takes 2hr45 roughly)
 using parameters:
	- 201901
	- AB
	- DEF
	- FSA
	- FZ2
	- FZ3

- Execute job FMP_EA_103_COPY_TILE_CACHE (took 1hr on test)

Then full code build and auto test run to update the service to version 1.1.8
