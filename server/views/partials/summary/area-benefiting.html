    <h3 class="heading-medium">area that benefits from flood defences</h3>
    <p>
      Land and property in this flood zone would have a high probability of flooding without the local flood defences. These protect the area against a river flood with a 1% chance of happening each year, or a flood from the sea with a 0.5% chance of happening each year.
