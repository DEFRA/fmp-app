<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Flood zones explained</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">Flood zones are based on how likely it is that a location will flood from rivers and the sea.</p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s"> Flood zone 1 </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Locations have a low probability of flooding, some locations will need a flood risk assessment.

      <p class="govuk-body"> There are flood defences in part or all of the location you selected. </p>
      <p class="govuk-body"> Flood defences: </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          reduce the probability of flooding from a specific source (a river or the sea), 
          but do not completely remove the risk
        </li>
        <li>
          can fail or a flood that is bigger than the one the defence is designed to protect against could happen
        </li>
        <li>
          may provide reduced protection over time because of climate change increasing flood risk in the future
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body"> There are different types of flood defence. They include: </p>
