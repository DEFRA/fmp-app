      How to use flood zones with climate change data
    </h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood zones with climate change data is given to help you further investigate flood risk.
    </p>

    <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">
      What are flood zones with climate change?
    </h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood zones with climate change is a data layer based on the flood zones with the addition of climate change
      modelled extents for the relevant scenarios.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The flood zones with climate change layer is produced by starting with flood zone 3
      (see <a href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/support/faqs/778338325">how flood zones are produced)</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We then add the following modelled extents for river and sea flooding, if they extend beyond flood zone 3:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

      <li> 1% (1 in 100) annual chance of river flooding with defences, with an allowance for climate change </li>
      <li> 0.5% (1 in 200) annual chance of tidal flooding with defences, with an allowance for climate change </li>
      <li> 1% (1 in 100) annual chance of river flooding without defences, with an allowance for climate change </li>
      <li> 0.5% (1 in 200) annual chance of tidal flooding without defences, with an allowance for climate change </li>
      <li>
        we also include 3.3% (1 in 20) annual chance of flooding with defences, with an allowance for climate change,
        where this extends beyond any of the other datasets.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We produce a similar layer using flood zone 2 as a starting point.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We then add the following modelled flood extents for river and sea flooding, if they extend beyond flood zone 2:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        0.1% (1 in 1,000) annual chance of river and sea flooding with defences, with an allowance for climate change
      </li>
      <li>
        0.1% (1 in 1,000) annual chance of river and sea flooding without defences, with an allowance for climate change
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      The largest extent is merged to create the flood zones with climate change layer, which is displayed on flood map
      for planning.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We subtract flood zones 2 and 3 from the flood zones with climate change layer.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood zones with climate change are not future flood zones.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Government planning guidance is clear that flood zones 2 and 3 do not account for climate change. Flood zones will
      continue to be updated over time to account for changes to our understanding of present day risk.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Future, updated flood zones may not be the same as the flood zones with climate change layer because:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        the effects of climate change on flood risk we may see in future could be different (better or worse) to those
        currently considered
      </li>
      <li>
        flood zones with climate change cannot account for future recorded flood outlines or other suitable data from
        third parties that may be produced in future.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      How should the data be used?

      The table below explains how the datasets shown on the flood map should be used in planning.

    <p class="govuk-body">
