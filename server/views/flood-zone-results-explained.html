      Flood zones and what they mean
    </h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood zones give you one type of flood risk information for the planning process.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      They are based on a location's chance of flooding from rivers or the sea in any year. They do not take into account:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        other sources of flooding
      </li>
      <li>
        future flood risk from rivers or the sea
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This means a site in flood zone 1 could still flood now or in the future.
    </p>

      Flood zone 1
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Locations in flood zone 1 have a low probability of flooding. This means in any year land has a less than 0.1% chance of flooding from rivers or the sea.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Some flood zone 1 developments need a flood risk assessment as part of their planning application. Find out

      Flood zone 2
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Locations in flood zone 2 have a medium probability of flooding. This means in any year land has between a 1% and 0.1% chance of flooding from rivers and between a 0.5% and 0.1% chance of flooding from the sea.

      Flood zone 3
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Locations in flood zone 3 have a high probability of flooding. This means in any year land has a 1% or more chance of flooding from rivers, or a 0.5% or more chance of flooding from the sea.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood zone 3 developments need to submit a flood risk assessment as part of their planning application.

        Flood defences
      </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        There are flood defences in part or all of the location you selected.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Flood defences:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li> reduce the probability of flooding from a specific source (a river or the sea) </li>
        <li>
          do not completely stop the chance of flooding because there may be a flood that is bigger than 
          the one the defence is designed to protect against (this is called overtopping), or the defence can fail
        </li>
        <li> may provide reduced protection over time because of climate change increasing flood risk in the future</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        There are different types of flood defence. They include:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>culverts</li>
