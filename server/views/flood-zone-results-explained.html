        Flood zones are based on how likely it is that a location will flood from rivers and the sea. They do not take into account:

        <li>climate change </li>

        Locations have a low probability of flooding, some locations will need a flood risk assessment. Find out

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Locations have a medium probability of flooding. Developments will need a flood risk assessment.

          <li> can fail or a flood that is bigger than the one the defence is designed to protect against could happen </li>
