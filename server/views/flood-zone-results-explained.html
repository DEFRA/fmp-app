            Flood defences reduce the probability of flooding from a particular source (a river or the sea) but do not completely remove the risk. They can fail or a flood could happen which is bigger than the one the defence is designed to protect against.

            Climate change will increase flood risk in future. This means the level of protection existing flood defences currently provide, will reduce over time. The site may also be at risk from other sources of flooding.
