    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood zones show areas of land that could flood from rivers (fluvial) or the sea (tidal), ignoring the benefits of any existing flood defences.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      They are based on a location's chance of flooding from rivers or the sea in any year. 
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood zones do not take into account:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>other sources of flooding</li>
      <li>the possible effects of climate change on rivers or the sea</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This means a site in flood zone 1 could still flood now or in the future.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood zones combine several datasets to create a picture of flood risk, including: 
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>undefended modelling</li>
      <li>defended modelling</li>
      <li>recorded flood outlines from past floods</li>
      <li>other suitable data from third parties</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood zones take account of flood risk from watercourses with a catchment area greater than 3 square kilometres. They do not have to be classified as main rivers. 
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Where we have data for watercourses with catchments smaller than 3 square kilometres, we will include it in the flood zones if we consider it suitable. 
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If a smaller catchment is not included in a flood zone it does not necessarily mean there is no flood risk. If your site is in a smaller catchment not included in a flood zone, you may need further assessment to understand all the risks. 
    </p>   

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Flood zone 1
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Locations in flood zone 1 have a low probability of flooding.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This means, in any year, land has a less than 0.1% (1 in 1,000) chance of flooding from rivers or the sea.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Some flood zone 1 developments need a flood risk assessment as part of their planning application. 
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Flood zone 2
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Locations in flood zone 2 have a medium probability of flooding.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This means, in any year, land has:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>between a 1% and 0.1% (between 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000) chance of flooding from rivers</li>
      <li>between a 0.5% and 0.1% (between 1 in 200 and 1 in 1,000) chance of flooding from the sea.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood zone 2 developments need a flood risk assessment as part of their planning application.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Flood zone 3
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Locations in flood zone 3 have a high probability of flooding. 
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      This means, in any year, land has:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a 1% (1 in 100) or more chance of flooding from rivers</li>
      <li>a 0.5% (1 in 200) or more chance of flooding from the sea.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Flood zone 3b (functional floodplain)
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Locations in flood zone 3b are at the highest risk of flooding.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood zone 3b is not shown on the flood map for planning service, as it is defined and mapped by local planning authorities (LPAs) in their strategic flood risk assessments.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      The difference between flood zones and flood extents
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood zones are sometimes different to the present day rivers and the sea extents because they combine several additional datasets to create a more complete picture of flood risk.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Flood defences
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood defences:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>reduce the probability of flooding from a specific source (a river or the sea)</li>
      <li>do not completely stop the chance of flooding because there may be a flood that is bigger than the one the defence is designed to protect against (this is called overtopping), or the defence can fail</li>
      <li>may provide reduced protection over time because of climate change increasing flood risk in the future</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      There are different types of flood defence. They include:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>embankments</li>
      <li>flood gates that are in line with the river</li>
      <li>flood walls</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can view a complete list of flood defences, called asset categories, on the 
      <a href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/asset-management/drl-app/revision/current/categories#Defence">Defra data services platform</a>.
