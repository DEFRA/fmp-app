    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl"> Flood zones and what they mean </h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood zones are based on a locationâ€™s chance of flooding from rivers or the sea in any year. They are used in the
      planning process to decide how likely it is a development could flood.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood zones do not take into account other sources of flooding. This means a site in flood zone 1 could still
      flood.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      To find out if a location is at risk of flooding from surface water, reservoirs and groundwater <a
        href="https://www.gov.uk/check-the-long-term-flood-risk/">check the long term flood risk for an area</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Flood zone 1
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Locations in flood zone 1 have a low probability of flooding. This means in any year land has a less than 0.1%
      chance of flooding from rivers or the sea.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Some flood zone 1 developments need a flood risk assessment as part of their planning application. Find out <a
        href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/flood-risk-assessment-for-planning-applications#when-you-need-an-assessment">when
        you need a flood risk assessment for development in flood zone 1</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Flood zone 2
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Locations in flood zone 2 have a medium probability of flooding. This means in any year land has between a 1% and
      0.1% chance of flooding from rivers and between a 0.5% and 0.1% chance of flooding from the sea.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood zone 2 developments need a flood risk assessment as part of their planning application.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Flood zone 3
    </h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Locations in flood zone 3 have a high probability of flooding. This means in any year land has a 1% or more chance
      of flooding from rivers and 0.5% or more chance of flooding from the sea.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Flood zone 3 developments need to submit a flood risk assessment as part of their planning application. This
      determines if the site is flood zone 3a or 3b.

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m"> Flood defences </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        There are flood defences in part or all of the location you selected.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body"> Flood defences: </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li> 
          reduce the probability of flooding from a specific source (a river or the sea)
        </li>
        <li> 
          do not completely stop the chance of flooding because there may be a flood that is bigger than the one the defence 
          is designed to protect against (this is called overtopping), or the defence can fail 
        </li>
        <li> may provide reduced protection over time because of climate change increasing flood risk in the future </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body"> There are different types of flood defence. They include: </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>culverts</li>
          <li>embankments</li>
          <li>flood walls</li>
