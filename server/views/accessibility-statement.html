        We are also working to fix the following map issues found in our most recent accessibility test:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          on the interactive map the heading structure of the page does not make use of a logical structure,
          which means screen reader users may not be able to identify the structure and relationship of content
          (WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.3.1, info and relationships)
        </li>
        <li>
          on the interactive map some heading text is styled as bold text, which means screen reader users cannot
          identify this as a heading (WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.3.1, info and relationships)
        </li>
        <li>
          there is nothing to indicate to screen reader users that the draw a boundary content is interactive,
          or what its purpose is (WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.3.1, info and relationships)
        </li>
        <li>
          on the interactive map colour was used as the only way of identifying keyboard focus in the listbox
          results when a user searches. This means that low vision users navigating the site using a keyboard
          may not be able to determine the focus on the page (WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.1, use of colour)
        </li>
        <li>
          the interactive map relies on the difference in colour alone to indicate the difference in flood zones,
          which means it may not be possible for some users to tell them apart (WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.1,
          use of colour)
        </li>
        <li>
          the ability to change the shape of a boundary is only available to users navigating the service using a
          mouse, which means users who cannot use a mouse to drag items are unable to edit the shape (WCAG 2.2
          success criterion 2.1.1, keyboard)
        </li>
        <li>
          on the interactive map, when selecting an option from the search listbox, users may not be able to
          cancel their selection once they have clicked the mouse. This means the list keeps closing and will
          not let the user select an option or scroll down the list without using the keyboard (WCAG 2.2 success
          criterion 2.5.2, pointer cancellation)
        </li>
        <li>
          the ability to change the shape of a boundary is only available to users navigating the service using a
          mouse, which means users who cannot use a mouse to drag items are unable to edit the shape (WCAG 2.2
          success criterion 2.5.7, dragging movements)
        </li>
        <li>
          screen reader users are not provided with instructions on how to navigate to the map content (WCAG 2.2
          success criterion 3.3.2, labels or instructions)
        </li>
        <li>
          there is nothing to indicate to screen reader users that the draw a boundary content is interactive,
          or what its purpose is (WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.2, name, role, value)
        </li>
        <li>
          when adding a site boundary, there are multiple buttons on the page such as ‘Add’, ‘Edit’ and ‘Delete’
          that do not have descriptive accessible name to describe their purpose (WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.6,
          headings and labels)
        </li>
        <li>
          content on the ‘Key’ panel of the map page could not be magnified without loss of information or
          functionality and without scrolling in 2 dimensions (WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.10, reflow)
        </li>
        <li>
          on the ‘Key’ panel of the map page, the colour contrast of the orange ‘Flood defence’ symbol against the
          white background does not meet the threshold, which may be problematic for some visually impaired users
          (WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.11, non-text contrast)
        </li>
        <li>
          the colour contrast of the overlapping data regions in the interactive map does not meet the threshold,
          which may be problematic for some visually impaired users (WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.11, non-text contrast)
        </li>
        <li>
          the colour contrast of the black target selector against the dark blue ‘Flood zone 3’ region does not meet
          the threshold, which may be problematic for some visually impaired users (WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.4.11,
          non-text contrast)
        </li>

        Improvements made following accessibility testing
      </h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        We have fixed the following issues after our most recent accessibility test:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>
          visibly hidden content is still conveyed to screen reader users, which can be confusing (WCAG 2.2 success
          criterion 1.3.1, info and relationships)
        </li>
        <li>
          radio buttons have not been grouped appropriately, which does not give enough description for screen reader
          users to identify their purpose when out of context (WCAG 2.2 success criterion 1.3.1, info and relationships)
        </li>
        <li>
          the interactive map on mobile devices was highly problematic for screen reader users (WCAG 2.2 success criterion
          1.3.1, info and relationships)
        </li>
        <li>
          the interactive map on mobile devices was highly problematic for screen reader users (WCAG 2.2 success criterion
          2.1.1, keyboard)
        </li>
        <li>
          on the ‘Check your details’ page an image is provided to users so that they can see their selected location. The
          image receives keyboard focus, which may be disorientating for users navigating by keyboard alone (WCAG 2.2
          success criterion 2.4.3, focus order)
        </li>
        <li>
          on returning to the ‘Order your flood risk data’ page via the ‘Back’ link, the ‘Full name’ data previously
          entered by the user is not retained (WCAG 2.2 success criterion 3.3.7, redundant entry)
        </li>
        <li>
          on the ‘Check your details’ page an image is provided to users so that they can see their selected location. An
          alternative to the image is provided to screen reader users but this is not conveyed when using the NVDA screen
          reader (WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.2, name, role, value)
        </li>
        <li>
          the ‘Hide this message’ button used in the cookie banner does not have a descriptive accessible name to describe
          its purpose (WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.6, headings and labels)
