          There are a number of elements of the map user interface that are not fully descriptive or accessible.

          These include:
        </p>

          <li>
            the colour contrast of the scale icon used on the Ordnance Survey mapping fails to meet the required contrast
            ratio (WCAG 1.4.3 Contrast - Level AA) in certain situations

          <li>
            we have explored ways to improve the accessibility of the controls on the map user interface, so that they are
            more descriptive and usable. We will identify the best way to do this and carry out this work by August 2024
          </li>
          <li>
            we have investigated a more accessible scheme to differentiate layers used in mapping across all flood
            services. We plan to carry out this work before August 2024
          </li>
          <li>
            we have investigated ways to provide more accessible versions of the Ordnance Survey mapping layers and have a
            range of options. We will identify the best option and put this in place by August 2024
